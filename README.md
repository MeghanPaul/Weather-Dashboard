# Weather-Dashboard
This is an application that allows the user to search for a city, then displays weather data about the current day and the next 5 days.

### Features
The last 10 searches are saved in the search history, and are stored and loaded from local storage. The user can select a previous search to see that data again.
The UV Index displays a color based on how save the index for the current day is. On loading the page, the browser focuses on the search bar, and once a search is completed,
the bar clears to allow another search to be made without extra keystrokes.
